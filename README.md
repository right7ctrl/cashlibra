Written in pinescript

## TradingView Configuration

- Set the candles as heikin-ashi
- Add the indicator as favorite on the link below or use the code on this repository
- Add Stoch RSI Indicator to TradingView
- Link on Tradingview: [https://tr.tradingview.com/script/3KvQHE75/]()

## How to use

- First of all, no signals are %100 guaranteed to work
- In case of getting an short/long signal; if a long trade is to be opened, it is appropriate for the Stoch RSI signal to cross above 40 for long trades and below 80 for short trades.
- You can check the buy/sell signals on screenshot below with stoch rsi. As you can see, we have to eliminate some signals and increase our chances because they do not meet the rsi conditions.
- All of these lines on indicator which are drawn by dots are the pivots, the price is expected to react from these levels.
- All of these lines on indicator which are pointed like S1/R1 etc. are fibonacci levels and the price is expected to react from these levels.
